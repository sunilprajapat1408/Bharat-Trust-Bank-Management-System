# Libraries

This folder contains external library files required to successfully run
the Bharat Trust Bank Management System.

## Purpose

The project uses external JAR libraries for database connectivity and
runtime support. Without these libraries, the application will not run
correctly.

## Libraries Used

- **MySQL JDBC Connector**
  - Used for establishing JDBC connection between the Java application
    and MySQL Workbench database.
  - Enables execution of SQL queries from Java code.

## Usage

These libraries are added to the project build path and are required at
runtime. Make sure all JAR files in this folder are properly configured
in the IDE before running the application.

## Note

Do not delete or modify these library files unless you update the
database configuration accordingly.
